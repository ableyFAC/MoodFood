// layout for this project

// 1) menu/home page:  asks how the user is feeling today (specific message @ a certain time)
// 2) restaurant selection: using user's mood, display restaurants with foods that fit the mood best (right now, just random & different restaurants)
// 3) food selection: user chooses a restaurant to order from, works like a typical online order (order as much as user wants until user decides to check out)

// initial vision: complete! as of 7/9/2025
