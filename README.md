Welcome! This is a coding project I've been working on since December 2024.

The project is an "app" that recommends restaurants based on the user's current mood. It doesn't use any advanced algorithms or AI (yet) to find actual restaurants around one's area, but this is my take on what it would look like.

College has been hectic, so expect updates to be sporadic.
